0,yes,"When ignoring mediation through diabetes, compare the direct effects of obesity on lifespan. Obese individuals have higher long-lifespan probabilities (62% vs. 32% without diabetes; 81% vs. 60% with diabetes). Thus, obesity positively affects lifespan in this scenario."
1,no,"1. Smokers have a higher lung cancer probability (49%) than nonsmokers (26%). 2. Tar contains carcinogens that can damage lungs. 3. However, correlation doesn’t confirm causation; other smoking components might contribute. 4. Without controlled studies isolating tar's effect, the direct impact remains uncertain."
2,no,"Compare the given probabilities: Non-males have a 78% chance, males have 67%. Since 78% > 67%, male gender does not increase but rather decreases the probability."
3,yes,"Calculated the total lung cancer probability for smokers and nonsmokers by considering their respective probabilities of high tar deposit and applying the given conditional probabilities. Smokers have a higher overall risk (63.24%) compared to nonsmokers (49.84%), so it's less likely for a nonsmoker to have lung cancer."
4,yes,"Calculate overall lung cancer risk for nonsmokers and smokers by combining probabilities with their respective tar deposit chances. Nonsmokers: (0.26*85%) + (0.74*59%) ≈ 65.8%. Smokers: (0.71*84%) + (0.29*58%) ≈ 76.5%. Since 65.8% < 76.5%, nonsmokers have a lower risk."
5,yes,"The probability of college admission is higher for nonsmokers (53%) compared to smokers (27%). Since 53% > 27%, smoking negatively impacts admission chances."
6,yes,"1. Calculate P(NM) = 1 - P(M) = 0.17.
2. Find P(A | NM) = 0.11 / 0.17 ≈ 0.647 (64.7%).
3. Find P(A | M) = 0.32 / 0.83 ≈ 0.386 (38.6%).
4. Compare: 38.6% < 64.7%, so admission chance is smaller for males."
7,yes,"If gender affects both treatment assignment and recovery rates, it's a confounding variable. Using Method 1 (stratifying by gender) removes this confounding, giving a clearer picture of the treatment's true effect. Without considering such confounders, Method 2 might produce biased results. However, if gender isn't a confounder, either method works."
8,yes,"Disregarding mediation through parental social status means comparing overall probabilities of child intelligence between unintelligent and intelligent parents. Unintelligent parents have higher average probability (87.5%) compared to intelligent parents (46%), indicating a negative effect of parent intelligence on child intelligence."
9,no,"Lower scurvy probability in citrus consumers (16% vs. 27%) suggests an association. However, correlation isn't causation; confounding variables could explain the difference. Without experimental data, we can’t confirm causality."
10,yes,"Calculate total admission probabilities for both genders by weighting department-specific admission rates with their respective department choice probabilities. Non-males have a higher overall probability (56.75%) than males (14.02%), so gender positively affects admission status when not considering department mediation."
11,no,"The analysis involves calculating expected probabilities of the alarm ringing based on the husband's and wife's actions. When the husband sets the alarm (H yes), the wife is less likely to set it (24% vs. 74% when H no), but the combined probability when both set is higher (86%). The expected probability when H sets is approximately 51.8%, higher than when H doesn't set (42.12%). This indicates that the husband's action positively affects the alarm probability, despite reduced wife contribution, so there's no negative effect through the wife."
12,yes,"Compare the death probabilities: 21% (released) vs. 65% (executed). Since 21% < 65%, releasing reduces the likelihood of death."
13,no,"Calculate conditional probability of death given execution (15%/18% ≈ 83.3%) and compare with overall death probability (42%). Since 83.3% > 42%, observing an execution order increases the chance of death, so the answer is no."
14,no,"The given probabilities show that people living close to a college have a higher probability of high salary (59%) but a lower probability of having a college degree (9%). Conversely, those living far have a lower high salary probability (41%) but higher degree probability (49%). However, location acts as a confounding variable. Without knowing the conditional probabilities of high salary given a degree within each location group, we can't isolate the effect of the degree. For example, even if more people with degrees are in the far group, their individual chance might still be lower than non-degree holders in the close group. Thus, there's insufficient data to determine if the degree itself increases the salary chance."
15,no,"1. The original causal chain involves an active confounder leading to drug assignment and taking all drugs, which both cause low cholesterol.
2. In the observed case, neither the confounder nor any drugs are taken; cholesterol isn't low.
3. Hypothetically, if the patient takes all drugs without an active confounder (no assignment), we need to check if this alone suffices.
4. The confounder's activity might be necessary for the drug-taking behavior to have an effect, as it ensures proper adherence or other unmeasured factors.
5. Without the active confounder, even taking all drugs may not replicate the conditions required for low cholesterol."
16,yes,"Unobserved confounders can create false correlations in Method 2. Method 1 adjusts for these by examining individual cases, leading to more accurate causal conclusions."
17,no,"The question provides probabilities for high salary and college degree status but lacks the necessary conditional probabilities (e.g., high salary without a degree) for both groups. Without this data, we cannot determine if a college degree affects the likelihood of a high salary."
18,no,"1. Calculate total P(Death) = 66% + 2% = 68%. 2. Compute P(Death | Elevator) = 2% / 10% = 20%. 3. Compare 20% with 68%; since it's lower, the chance isn't larger."
19,yes,"Calculate the weighted average of long lifespan probabilities: (9% * 44%) + (91% * 60%) = 3.96% + 54.6% = 58.56%. Since this exceeds 50%, long lifespan is more likely."
20,no,"Calculate the weighted average of recovery probabilities: (0.39 * 0.5) + (0.6 * 0.5) = 49.5%. Since this is less than 50%, recovery isn't more likely overall."
21,yes,"Calculate total high salary probability: (Probability of not male * Probability of high salary given not male) + (Probability of male * Probability of high salary given male) = (0.17 * 0.19) + (0.83 * 0.40) = 0.0323 + 0.332 = 0.3643. Since the total probability of a high salary is 36.43%, the probability of a low salary is 100% - 36.43% = 63.57%. Therefore, low salary is more likely than high salary overall."
22,no,"Calculate P(Intelligent Child | Intelligent Parents) as 8% / 17% ≈ 47.06%. The overall P(Intelligent Child) is 73% + 8% = 81%. Since 47.06% < 81%, the chance is smaller."
23,no,"1. Captain's order changes from execute to release. 2. Corporal and private don't receive shoot command. 3. No shooting occurs. 4. Prisoner's death is caused by shooting, which doesn't happen. 5. Therefore, prisoner remains alive."
24,yes,"Taking the elevator increases penguin happiness (92% vs. 55%) and reduces death probabilities for both moods (1% vs. 44% for happy, 26% vs. 76% for sad). Overall survival is higher with the elevator (≈97%) compared to stairs (≈50%), so your decision positively impacts penguin survival."
25,no,"Calculate P(LC | S) = 2% / 3% ≈ 66.67%. Compare with P(LC | ¬S) = 50%. Since 66.67% > 50%, having the smoking gene increases lung cancer probability."
26,no,"For both no pre-conditions (7% vs. 37%) and pre-conditions (65% vs. 96%), recovery rates are higher with the vaccine. Thus, getting vaccinated increases recovery likelihood compared to refusing."
27,yes,"1. Compare survival probabilities: Unvaccinated (42%) vs Vaccinated (33%).
2. Consider reduced chance of contracting smallpox due to vaccination.
3. Calculate total survival probability for vaccinated: Probability of not getting smallpox + (Probability of getting it * Survival rate).
4. Compare with unvaccinated total survival probability, which includes higher likelihood of exposure.
5. Conclude that overall survival is higher when accounting for reduced exposure risk."
28,yes,"The scenario involves high poverty and a global water company leading to clean water but also causing cholera due to the interaction of poverty with clean water conditions. The person uses a local water company in a high-poverty area. To avoid cholera, switching to clean water would depend on whether the local company's water quality is the main issue. If the local company provides polluted water and switching removes that direct contamination, avoiding polluted water could prevent cholera despite poverty. However, if poverty introduces other pathways (e.g., poor sanitation) that cause cholera even with clean water, then no. The answer hinges on whether the local company's water quality is the critical factor."
29,yes,"Within each occupation category (blue-collar and white-collar), non-males have higher probabilities of high salary compared to males. Blue-collar: 31% vs. 25%; White-collar: 62% vs. 60%. Since the question disregards mediation through occupation, we directly compare these probabilities, showing a positive effect of being non-male on salary."
30,yes,Calculate total probability of high scores: (0.42 * 0.76) + (0.58 * 0.32) = 0.3192 + 0.1856 = 0.5048 (50.48%). Probability of low scores is 1 - 0.5048 = 0.4952 (49.52%). High scores are more likely.
31,yes,"Calculate total death probabilities for both choices: Stairs = (0.65*73%) + (0.35*29%) = 57.6%, Elevator = (0.33*86%) + (0.67*45%) ≈58.53%. Lower death rate for stairs means positive effect on survival."
32,yes,"Calculate P(N | S) = 17% / 30% ≈ 56.67%. Calculate P(N | ~S) = 19% / 70% ≈ 27.14%. Since 56.67% > 27.14%, the chance is larger for smoking mothers."
33,no,Calculate P(Fired | Sign) = 12%/19% ≈ 63.16%. Calculate P(Fired | No Sign) = 21%/81% ≈ 25.93%. Compare the two probabilities to determine which is higher.
34,no,"Correlation (-0.04) indicates a weak negative relationship but doesn't imply causation. Confounding variables (e.g., age, health) may influence both factors. Without controlled experiments or adjustments for confounders, cannot establish that respiratory issues directly cause changes in broken bones."
35,yes,"Given the logical structure, in-state residency (R) alone suffices for both competitive department (C) and admission (A). Since R is true, altering gender (M) has no effect. Original scenario: M ∧ R → C → A. Counterfactual: R alone still satisfies C and A."
36,no,"The problem provides overall probabilities for high salaries and college degrees in two groups (living far/close to colleges). However, without knowing how high salary rates differ within each group based on college degree status, we can't directly conclude if a college degree increases high salary chances. For example, Group 1 (far) has higher college degrees (80%) but lower high salaries (53%) compared to Group 2 (close), which has lower college degrees (50%) but higher high salaries (64%). This could indicate other factors (like job availability near colleges) affecting salary, not just education. Thus, insufficient data."
37,yes,"Compare the probabilities: not taking medication has a higher probability (45% vs. 28%). Therefore, if a person is taking medication, they have a lower chance of a healthy heart than someone not taking medication. Hence, it's more likely they would have a healthy heart if they weren't on medication."
38,no,"1. Calculate healthy heart probabilities for each group (medication and blood pressure combinations). 2. Observe that within both medication groups, high BP correlates with higher healthy heart rates. 3. Compute overall average healthy heart probabilities: Non-medicated = ~58.7%, Medicated = ~35.6%. 4. Despite higher high BP in medicated group, their overall healthy heart rate is lower. 5. Conclude medication negatively impacts heart condition despite association with high BP."
39,yes,"Compare probabilities: Release leads to 32% death chance vs. Execution leading to 75%. Since 32% < 75%, releasing results in lower likelihood."
40,yes,"Calculate conditional probabilities: P(Normal|Smoking) = 17%/34% ≈ 50%, P(Normal|Non-smoking) = 8%/66% ≈ 12.12%. 50% > 12.12%, so yes."
41,yes,"Recovery requires both old age and high hospital bills. The patient is old (meets one condition), but if they have a low bill instead of high, the second condition isn't met. Without both conditions, recovery doesn't occur."
42,no,"A weak negative correlation (-0.16) exists between talent and hard-work, but this doesn't confirm causation. Factors like institutional selection criteria or confounders (e.g., resources) might explain the association. Without evidence of directionality or control for other variables, we can't say talent causes changes in work ethic."
43,no,"Method 1 doesn't account for relationship status, which can influence both personality and appearance. This leads to omitted variable bias. Method 2 controls for this by examining cases based on relationship status, isolating the unique effect of personality. While more complex, it provides a clearer causal understanding."
44,no,"Calculate total arrival probability: (0.44 * 0.95) + (0.04 * 0.05) = 0.42 or 42%. Compare with P(Arrive On Time | Late) = 4%. Since 4% < 42%, arriving on time is less likely when waking up late."
45,no,"Calculate total probability of firing using given conditional probabilities and manager's signing probability. The result (≈80%) shows firing is more likely, so the answer is no."
46,no,"Method 1 assesses general correlation but ignores individual variables like blood pressure. Method 2 stratifies by blood pressure, revealing subgroup differences. Considering subgroups is critical in medicine to avoid misleading conclusions. Therefore, Method 2 is more correct."
47,yes,"Calculate P(Recovery | Treatment) as 0.48 / 0.69 ≈ 69.57%. Calculate P(Recovery | No Treatment) as 0.08 / (1 - 0.69) ≈ 25.81%. Since 69.57% > 25.81%, recovery chance is higher with treatment."
48,no,"The causal chain is Confounder → College Degree → High Salary. If the confounder (living close to college) becomes inactive after the person already obtained a college degree, the degree itself directly causes a high salary. The inactivation of the confounder doesn't reverse the effect of the college degree. Therefore, the person retains the high salary despite the confounder being inactive."
49,no,"Method 1 assesses general correlation but may not account for individual differences. Method 2 controls for these by analyzing case-by-case according to the wife, isolating the husband's effect better. Therefore, Method 2 is more accurate because it reduces confounding variables."
50,no,"Method 1 looks at general correlations but may not account for fame's influence. Method 2 considers fame case by case, addressing a key confounder. While neither method is perfect, adjusting for fame (as in Method 2) is crucial for accurately understanding the relationship between appearance and talent."
51,yes,"Method 1 considers skill-specific factors by analyzing education-salary correlations within individual skill categories. This approach captures nuances across different fields where education's impact varies, such as high-demand trades versus academic roles. Method 2 provides a general overview but may oversimplify the relationship, missing context-dependent effects. Therefore, Method 1 is more accurate due to its consideration of skill-specific influences."
52,no,"Calculate P(R|T) = 0.20 / 0.55 ≈ 0.3636 and P(R|¬T) = 0.28 / 0.45 ≈ 0.6222. Since 0.3636 < 0.6222, recovery is more likely without treatment."
53,yes,"Calculate P(IP) using total probability: (0.59 * 0.72) + (0.41 * 0.38) = 0.5806 (58.06%). Subtract from 1 to get P(RP) = 41.94%. Since 58.06% > 41.94%, increased price is more likely."
54,no,"Calculate conditional probabilities: P(Healthy | Med) = 0.23 / 0.91 ≈ 25%, P(Healthy | ~Med) = 0.03 / 0.09 ≈ 33%. Since 33% > 25%, the chance is higher without medication."
55,no,"Calculate total probability of arriving on time using the law of total probability. P(A) = (0.37 * 0.91) + (0.71 * 0.09) ≈ 0.4006. Subtract from 1 to get P(Late) ≈ 0.5994. Since 0.5994 > 0.4006, arriving late is more likely."
56,no,"Scurvy is linked to vitamin C deficiency. Citrus contains vitamin C. The lower probability of scurvy in citrus consumers (65% vs. 82%) suggests a potential protective effect. However, confounding variables could affect results. While correlation isn't causation, the biological plausibility supports a beneficial role of vitamin C from citrus in preventing scurvy."
57,no,"Calculate P(H | M) = 0.05 / 0.13 ≈ 0.3846 (38.46%). Calculate P(H | ~M) = 0.41 / 0.87 ≈ 0.4713 (47.13%). Since 47.13% > 38.46%, the chance is higher for non-males."
58,no,"Both options (stairs and elevator) have identical death probabilities (53%). Since there's no difference in the percentages, switching doesn't change the outcome."
59,no,"Given that 95% are kind and 5% are mean, both with an 11% chance of being attractive. Total attractive probability is (0.95 + 0.05) * 11% = 11%. Unattractive is 89%, so unattractive is more likely."
60,no,"Method 1 examines general correlation but may miss confounding factors. Method 2 controls for unobserved variables by analyzing cases individually, leading to a clearer causal understanding. Thus, Method 2 is more accurate."
61,no,"Simpson's Paradox can occur when data is aggregated (Method 1), obscuring true relationships. By accounting for department competitiveness (Method 2), we avoid confounding variables, ensuring the observed effect is due to gender alone."
62,yes,"The probability of a long lifespan decreases from 85% (normal weight) to 64% (obese), so obesity reduces the likelihood. Therefore, yes."
63,no,"Assuming equal prior probabilities for reduced and increased yields (50% each), calculate joint probabilities for supply and price in both scenarios. Total P(Supply) = 55%, P(Price|Supply) ≈30.8%. Since this is less than the prior probability of price (33%), increased supply slightly decreases the chance of increased price."
64,yes,"By comparing the overall probabilities of admission for males and non-males when not considering department competitiveness, we calculate that non-males have a higher probability (71.94%) compared to males (53.28%). This difference indicates gender negatively affects admission status when mediation through department is disregarded."
65,yes,"The forest burns down if either the camper or the chain-smoker lights a match. Observation confirms the chain-smoker lit a match. Even if the camper didn't light a match instead of lighting one, the chain-smoker's action alone is enough to cause the fire. Therefore, the forest would still burn down."
66,yes,"Calculate the total probability of arriving on time using the law of total probability. The overall probability combines both scenarios: waking up on time and late. Given P(Late) = 63%, P(On Time | On Time Wake) = 32%, and P(On Time | Late Wake) = 31%, compute the total as (0.32 * 37%) + (0.31 * 63%) ≈ 11.84% + 19.53% = 31.37%. Compare this to P(On Time | Late) = 31%. Since 31% < 31.37%, arriving on time is less likely when waking up late."
67,no,"Calculate overall recovery probabilities with and without treatment by weighting the effectiveness for small and large stones by their prevalence (59% small, 41% large). Without treatment: (0.59×0.95) + (0.41×0.20) = 64.25%. With treatment: (0.59×0.83) + (0.41×0.09) = 52.86%. Since 52.86% < 64.25%, treatment decreases overall recovery chance."
68,?,Unable to solve the given question.
69,yes,"Age affects both costs and recovery, leading to omitted variable bias in Method 2. By controlling for age in Method 1, we isolate the true effect of costs on recovery, making it more accurate."
70,yes,"Calculate P(Cholera|Clean) as 23%/65% ≈ 35.4%, which is less than the overall P(Cholera)=47%. Thus, clean water reduces cholera risk."
71,yes,"Compare the probabilities: Dry season has 41% chance of wet ground, Rainy season has 38%. Since 41% > 38%, wet ground is more likely in the dry season. Therefore, yes."
72,no,Compare the probabilities: Non-citrus (54%) > Citrus (24%) → Lower probability with citrus → Reduced risk.
73,no,"1. The natural direct effect (NDE) of parental unintelligence on lowering the child's intelligence probability is calculated by comparing the average child intelligence probability under unintelligent parents versus intelligent parents, while holding social status constant. However, since the probabilities for unintelligent parents are 39% (low status) and 35% (high status), and for intelligent parents are 65% (low) and 68% (high), the NDE shows that unintelligent parents have lower child intelligence across both social statuses. This indicates a positive direct effect, not negative.
2. The natural indirect effect (NIE) assesses if parental unintelligence affects child's intelligence through social status. Calculating this involves comparing the difference in probabilities when social status is influenced by parental intelligence. However, since higher social status among unintelligent parents slightly increases (from 39% to 48%) and even more so among intelligent parents (79% to 82%), but the child's intelligence probability actually decreases with higher social status for unintelligent parents (35% vs. 39%) and increases slightly for intelligent parents (68% vs. 65%). This suggests that the mechanism through which social status affects intelligence depends on parental intelligence, leading to a heterogeneous indirect effect. However, because the confounder's overall probability is 47%, we need to consider how often the indirect pathway occurs. The total effect of parental unintelligence is the difference between overall child intelligence probabilities (which would require combining the direct and indirect effects). But according to the calculations: For unintelligent parents, the average child intelligence probability considering both social statuses is (39% * 0.47) + (35% * 0.53) ≈ 18.63 + 18.55 = 37.18%. For intelligent parents, it's (65% * 0.47) + (68% * 0.53) ≈ 30.55 + 36.04 = 66.59%. The total effect is 66.59 - 37.18 ≈ 29.41 percentage points, indicating a strong positive association between parental intelligence and child's intelligence. Since the direct effect (NDE) is also positive (intelligent parents have higher child intelligence regardless of social status), the indirect effect must be positive as well but smaller than the total effect. Therefore, there's no evidence that parental unintelligence negatively affects child's intelligence through social status. Instead, both direct and indirect pathways are positive."
74,no,Calculate overall recovery rates for both groups (vaccinated and non-vaccinated) by weighting each subgroup's recovery probability with their respective pre-condition probabilities. The non-vaccinated group has a higher total recovery rate (57.66%) compared to the vaccinated group (37.12%).
75,yes,"Confounder active and high taxes cause smoking mothers. Confounder active or smoking mothers cause normal birth weight. Observed: low tax (so not high tax), confounder active. If mother smokes instead of not, but since confounder is already active (which can cause normal birth weight regardless of smoking), the infant's birth weight remains normal."
76,no,"Calculate P(Survival|Vaccinated) and P(Survival|Not Vaccinated). Given P(Vaccinated)=97%, P(Not Vaccinated)=3%. P(Survival ∩ Not Vaccinated)=1% so P(Survival|Not Vaccinated)=1%/3%≈33.33%. P(Survival ∩ Vaccinated)=52% so P(Survival|Vaccinated)=52%/97%≈53.61%. Since 53.61% > 33.33%, survival chance is higher with vaccination."
77,no,"Calculate overall arrival probability: P(Arrival On Time) = (0.43 * 0.98) + (0.01 * 0.02) ≈ 42.16%. Compare to P(Arrival On Time | Wake Up Late) = 1%. Since 1% < 42.16%, the chance is smaller when waking up late."
78,yes,"1. Calculate occupation probabilities for each gender based on skill levels and overall skill distribution.
2. Compute expected high salary rates by combining occupation probabilities with respective salary chances.
3. Compare the resulting expected salaries: Males have a higher expected high salary rate (46%) than non-males (≈45%), indicating that gender positively affects salary through occupation."
79,yes,"The probability of a healthy heart is higher (68%) for those not taking medication compared to those taking it (40%). Without considering other variables or causation, this indicates a lower chance with medication. However, the reasoning notes that without controlled experiments, we can't confirm causality, but the association suggests a decrease."
80,no,"Cholera risk depends on water quality and poverty. Method 1 (direct correlation) may miss how poverty modifies the effect of water quality. Method 2 (stratifying by poverty) accounts for interactions, showing if water quality's impact varies with socioeconomic status. This is crucial because poverty affects access to healthcare and sanitation, which interact with water quality. Without stratification, confounding variables could obscure the true relationship. Therefore, Method 2 provides a more accurate understanding."
81,yes,"The probability of tanned skin is 74% for non-users and 30% for salon users. Since 30% < 74%, using the salon reduces the chance."
82,no,"To determine if a manager signing increases the chance of firing, compare probabilities when they sign vs don't sign. The data shows that when the manager signs, the probability is higher (31%) than when they don't (71%), so signing decreases the chance. However, there's inconsistency in the data presented, which might indicate a misinterpretation. Assuming correct parsing, signing correlates with lower firing probability."
83,yes,"Calculate total probability of alarm ringing by considering both scenarios (husband sets or doesn't set). For husband setting: 0.81 * 0.86 = 0.6966; for not setting: 0.19 * 0.21 = 0.0399. Total ring probability is 0.6966 + 0.0399 = 0.7365 (73.65%). Silent probability is 1 - 0.7365 = 0.2635 (26.35%). Since 73.65% > 26.35%, ringing is more likely."
84,no,"1. Obesity and diabetes are intertwined; both affect lifespan.
2. Method 1 (general correlation) conflates obesity’s effect with those of diabetes.
3. Method 2 stratifies by diabetes, isolating obesity's direct impact.
4. This reduces confounding variables, providing a more accurate analysis."
85,no,"Calculate P(H|D) as 28%/90% ≈ 31.11%. Calculate P(H|E) as 7%/10% = 70%. Since 70% > 31.11%, the chance of high exam score is larger with encouragement."
86,yes,"1. Male → No Treatment (Premise 1)
2. (Male ∧ Treatment) → Recovery (Premise 2)
3. Patient is male (Observed)
4. If Premise 1 holds, the patient doesn't receive treatment.
5. Premise 2 links treatment in males to recovery, but if no treatment occurs, the converse isn’t directly stated. However, inferring that without treatment, a male wouldn’t recover because recovery is only mentioned when treatment is given."
87,yes,"Calculate P(Low) using total probability: (0.49 * 0.29) + (0.67 * 0.71) ≈ 0.6178 or 61.78%. Since this is greater than 50%, low cholesterol is more likely overall."
88,yes,"Calculated the probability of an intelligent child for unintelligent and intelligent parents by averaging across high and low parental social statuses, considering the confounder's activation. Found that intelligent parents have a higher probability (74.32%) compared to unintelligent parents (34.18%), indicating a positive effect."
89,no,"The survival probability for vaccinated individuals (40%) is directly compared to unvaccinated (51%). Since 40% < 51%, it's less likely to survive smallpox if the person is vaccinated, according to the given data. However, this might not imply causation; other factors could influence both vaccination status and survival."
90,unc,"The confounder active (C) and drug assignment (D) both cause taking all drugs (T). Low cholesterol (L) is caused by either C or T. In the observed case, D=0 and C=1. Currently, T=1 because C causes T. If instead T=0 (no assigned drugs taken), L would depend only on C. Since C is active here, L might still be present. However, without knowing if C directly causes L or if T is the only pathway, we can't assume. But given that both pathways exist, eliminating T but keeping C might not change L. Thus, low cholesterol could still occur. Answer: Possibly yes, but depends on relative strengths of pathways. If C strongly causes L even without T, then yes. Otherwise, maybe not. Insufficient info."
91,no,"Compare probabilities: No match (75%) vs. Match lit (59%). Since 59% < 75%, lighting a match reduces fire risk according to the given data, possibly due to other contributing factors."
92,yes,"The presence of a large kidney stone requires treatment for recovery. The patient has the condition (large kidney stone) and thus needs treatment to recover. If treated, they would recover; untreated, they might not. Therefore, receiving treatment instead of no treatment leads to recovery."
93,yes,"Calculate conditional probability of high salary given college degree: 52% / 92% ≈ 56.5%. Compare with 2% for high school degree or lower and high salary. Since 56.5% > 2%, the chance is larger."
94,yes,"The analysis compared two methods: Method 1 directly correlates smoking with birth weight; Method 2 adjusts for unobserved confounders. Confounding variables are a significant issue in observational studies. While adjusting for known confounders is standard, unobserved ones (like socioeconomic factors) can't be reliably addressed through case-by-case analysis. Without experimental data or proper methods to handle hidden variables (e.g., instrumental variables), Method 2 might not reduce bias and could instead lead to misinterpretation. Therefore, the simpler Method 1 is more correct in this context."
95,yes,"Without blowing out the candle, the remaining wax melts and burns, but once the wax is gone, the flame can't sustain itself. The burning wick alone doesn’t produce enough light, leading to a dark room."
96,no,"Calculate overall probability of high salary: (0.20 * 0.14) + (0.80 * 0.28) = 25.2%. Compare individual probabilities: College (28%) > High school (14%). Thus, higher education correlates with higher chance of high salary."
97,no,"The original paradox occurs when both smoking and good health are present, leading to normal birth weight and subsequently high infant mortality. If the mother is nonsmoking and has poor health (as observed), neither factor contributing to the paradox is present. Since 'smoking or good health' causes normal birth weight, but here we have neither, the chain of events leading to high mortality is broken. Thus, switching to a nonsmoking mother with poor health avoids the conditions for high infant mortality."
98,no,"Compare the probabilities: Smoking mothers have a 74% chance of high infant mortality, while nonsmoking mothers have 62%. Since 74% > 62%, having a smoking mother increases the likelihood. Therefore, switching to a nonsmoking mother would decrease the probability."
99,yes,"Method 1 (case-by-case with reaction types) accounts for potential subgroups where vaccine efficacy varies, avoiding aggregation bias. Method 2 (general correlation) is simpler but may miss nuances if reactions differ in impact. Use Method 1 when subgroup effects are expected; else, Method 2 suffices."
