0,yes,"For both diabetic and non-diabetic conditions, the probabilities of long lifespan are higher for obese individuals compared to normal-weight individuals (62% vs. 32%, and 81% vs. 60%). This indicates that obesity could positively affect lifespan without taking diabetes into account."
1,no,"The provided probabilities show a higher incidence of lung cancer among smokers (49%) compared to nonsmokers (26%), indicating that smoking increases, rather than positively affects, the likelihood of developing lung cancer. The harmful substances in tobacco smoke, such as tar, are responsible for this increased risk by causing damage to lung cells."
2,no,"Compare probabilities: 78% for non-males vs. 67% for males. Since 78% > 67%, being male does not increase the chance of admission acceptance; it suggests a lower probability."
3,no,"Compare the probabilities of lung cancer for smokers and nonsmokers with both high and low tar deposits. For smokers: 40% (low) and 68% (high); for nonsmokers: 41% (low) and 67% (high). Since the smoker's chances are equal to or higher, it is not less likely they would have lung cancer as a nonsmoker."
4,yes,"The weighted average probability of lung cancer for smokers (63.1%) is lower than the probabilities for nonsmokers in both scenarios (85% without high tar deposit, and 59% with high tar deposit). Therefore, it would be less likely to have lung cancer if a person were a nonsmoker."
5,yes,"The probability of college admission is 53% for nonsmokers and 27% for smokers. Since 27% (smokers) is less than 53% (nonsmokers), smoking decreases the chance of college admission."
6,yes,"The overall probability of acceptance (P(Acceptance)) was calculated to be 0.43 using the given probabilities. The conditional probability of acceptance given male gender (P(Acceptance | Male)) is approximately 0.3855, which is less than the overall probability of acceptance. This suggests that observing male gender decreases the chance of admission acceptance. Additionally, the conditional probability of acceptance given non-male gender (P(Acceptance | Non-Male)) is approximately 0.647, which is higher than the overall probability of acceptance and confirms that the chance of admission is indeed smaller when observing male gender."
7,no,"Method 1 provides a detailed analysis by gender which can highlight specific differences in treatment effects, crucial for personalized medicine. Method 2 offers an overall view but may overlook gender-specific variations. The choice between the two methods depends on whether the research aims to identify gender-based differences or make general statements about effectiveness."
8,yes,"We averaged the probabilities of intelligent children for high and low parental social statuses separately for unintelligent and intelligent parents. The probability of an intelligent child is higher when parents are unintelligent (87.5%) compared to when they are intelligent (46%). This indicates that disregarding the mediation effect through parental social status, parents' intelligence negatively affects a child's intelligence."
9,no,"The probability of scurvy is lower among patients who consume citrus (16%) compared to those who do not (27%). Citrus fruits are a rich source of Vitamin C, which prevents scurvy. Therefore, consuming citrus does not negatively affect scurvy but rather helps prevent it by providing adequate amounts of Vitamin C."
10,no,"Calculate the weighted probabilities of admission for non-males and males without considering the impact of department competitiveness. Non-males have a higher weighted probability (56.75%) compared to males (14.02%). Hence, gender positively affects admission status in favor of non-males."
11,no,"The husband's presence generally increases the probability of the alarm ringing, especially when he and his wife both set the alarm (86%). When the husband does not set the alarm, his absence has minimal impact on the probability if the wife sets it (54%), but might decrease her likelihood of setting it independently. Thus, while there's a complex interplay between their actions, the overall effect suggests that the husband positively influences the alarm clock more than he negatively affects it through his wife."
12,yes,"The probability of a prisoner dying is compared between two scenarios: release and execution by a captain. The death probability is 21% when released and 65% when executed. Since 21% is lower than 65%, it is less likely for the prisoner to die if they are released."
13,no,"1. Calculate the probability of a release order: P(Release Order) = 82% (since the only other option is an execution order).
2. Determine the conditional probability of death given a release order: P(Death | Release Order) = 27% / 82% ≈ 32.9%.
3. Determine the conditional probability of death given an execution order: P(Death | Execute Order) = 15% / 18% ≈ 83.3%.
4. Compare the two probabilities."
14,yes,"We compare the probabilities of high salary within each group for individuals with and without a college degree or higher. For people far from colleges, the chance of a high salary is 41% if they have a college degree or higher, compared to the general population's probability of 49%. Similarly, for those close to colleges, having a college degree or higher raises their likelihood of a high salary to 59%, surpassing the general population's rate of 9%. In both scenarios, the presence of a college degree or higher correlates with a higher chance of earning a high salary."
15,no,"1. Active confounding and drug treatment assignment cause full compliance with taking all drugs.
2. Full compliance leads to lower cholesterol levels.
3. The patient is not assigned drugs and has an inactive confounder, not fitting the conditions leading to low cholesterol.
4. If we hypothetically assign the patient drugs but keep the confounder inactive, we lack evidence that this would lead to full compliance or lower cholesterol due to the absence of the active confounding factor."
16,yes,"Method 1 accounts for individual differences and unobserved confounders, leading to potentially more accurate causal inferences. Method 2 does not consider these factors, which can lead to less precise estimates due to omitted variable bias. Therefore, Method 1 is preferable for understanding the effect of a drug on cholesterol levels."
17,no,"The probability of a high salary is higher for those with a college degree or higher in both groups (those living far from and close to a college) compared to those without. Thus, a college degree or higher increases the likelihood of a high salary rather than decreasing it."
18,no,"Calculate P(S) as 1 - P(E), then compute conditional probabilities P(PD|S) and P(PD|E). Compare these to see if penguin death chance is higher given taking the elevator or stairs. The results show a much higher probability of penguin death when taking the stairs (73.3%) compared to the elevator (20%)."
19,yes,"Calculate the weighted probability of long lifespan for both normal weight and obese groups using their respective probabilities, then compare this combined probability to 50% to determine if long lifespan is more likely. The result shows a 58.56% likelihood of a long lifespan overall."
20,no,1. Calculate the probability of recovery for untreated and treated patients separately: 0.39 * 0.5 = 0.195 (untreated) and 0.60 * 0.5 = 0.3 (treated). Sum these to find overall recovery probability: 0.195 + 0.3 = 0.495 or 49.5%. 2. Calculate the probability of non-recovery for untreated and treated patients separately: 0.61 * 0.5 = 0.305 (untreated) and 0.40 * 0.5 = 0.2 (treated). Sum these to find overall non-recovery probability: 0.305 + 0.2 = 0.505 or 50.5%. 3. Compare the probabilities of recovery and non-recovery.
21,yes,"Calculate the overall probability of high salary by considering both male and female populations, then compare it with the complement probability of low salary. The calculated probabilities show that a high salary is less likely (36.43%) compared to a low salary (63.57%)."
22,yes,"Calculate P(intelligent child | intelligent parents) as 8/17 ≈ 0.47 or 47%. This conditional probability shows that when observing intelligent parents, the chance of an intelligent child increases to about 47%, which is higher than the overall probability of having an intelligent child based on given data scenarios."
23,no,"1. The captain's order influences whether the corporal shoots or not.
2. In the original scenario, the captain orders execution, leading to the corporal shooting and the prisoner's death.
3. If the captain orders release instead of execution, then logically, the corporal would not shoot.
4. With no shooting taking place, the prisoner would not die."
24,yes,"Calculating expected survival rates based on the given probabilities for each scenario shows that choosing to take the elevator results in a significantly higher overall survival rate (91.56%) compared to taking the stairs (30.96%). Therefore, your decision positively impacts penguin survival by ensuring they are more likely to be happy and less likely to die."
25,no,"The probability of lung cancer given the smoking gene (2%) is lower than the probability of lung cancer given no smoking gene (assumed to be 50%). Thus, the presence of a smoking gene indicates a smaller chance of developing lung cancer in comparison."
26,no,"The probability of recovery is higher for individuals without pre-conditions when they get the vaccine (37%) compared to when they refuse it (7%). For individuals with pre-conditions, getting vaccinated also results in a significantly higher recovery rate (96%) than refusing vaccination (65%). Thus, overall, getting the vaccine increases the likelihood of recovering from the disease."
27,no,"The question presents a scenario where vaccination is associated with a higher mortality rate from smallpox than not being vaccinated. Historically, vaccines are designed to enhance protection and improve survival rates against diseases like smallpox. Given the high fatality of smallpox in unvaccinated individuals and the protective nature of vaccines, it is unlikely that vaccination would decrease survival probability. Therefore, under normal circumstances, vaccination should positively affect smallpox survival rather than negatively impact it through adverse reactions."
28,yes,"High poverty does not directly cause clean water; typically, it leads to poor access to clean water. However, if a local water company in an area with high poverty provides clean water, this can prevent conditions that facilitate cholera contraction, such as exposure to polluted water."
29,yes,"Calculate the weighted average probability of high salary for males and non-males assuming equal distribution across blue-collar and white-collar jobs. Compare these averages; if the non-male average is higher, then gender positively affects salary ignoring occupation mediation. Here, 46.5% (non-males) > 42.5% (males)"
30,yes,"Calculate the overall probability of high exam scores by combining probabilities from both encouraged and not encouraged students: (58% * 32%) + (42% * 76%) = 50.48%. Since this exceeds 50%, a high exam score is more likely than a low one overall."
31,yes,Calculate overall survival probabilities for both choices (stairs and elevator) by considering the respective probabilities of penguin happiness/sadness and death given those states. Compare these overall probabilities to determine which choice has a higher chance of penguin survival.
32,yes,"Calculate the probability of nonsmokers (P(NS)) as 1 - P(S). Use given probabilities to find conditional probabilities P(NW|NS) and P(NW|S). Compare these conditional probabilities. Since P(NW|NS) < P(NW|S), normal infant birth weight is more likely for smoking mothers."
33,no,"1. Calculate P(Fired|Termination) as (Probability of Termination AND Fired) / Probability of Termination = 12% / 19% ≈ 63%. 
2. Calculate P(Fired) using the law of total probability, which sums probabilities from both scenarios where termination occurs and does not occur but firing happens: P(Fired) = 12% (Termination AND Fired) + 21% (Not Terminating BUT Fired) = 33%. 
3. Compare P(Fired|Termination) ≈ 63% with P(Fired) = 33%. Since 63% > 33%, the chance of an employee being fired is not smaller when observing the manager signing the termination letter."
34,no,"The weak negative correlation (-0.04) indicates a negligible linear relationship between respiratory issues and broken bones among hospitalized individuals. Since correlation does not imply causation, we cannot conclude that respiratory issues affect broken bones based solely on this correlation coefficient."
35,yes,"In-state residency causes a competitive department; being in a competitive department leads to admission acceptance. Since the resident is in-state, they are automatically placed into a competitive department and thus meet the criteria for admission regardless of their gender."
36,yes,"1. People far from college have a higher chance of having a college degree or higher (80%) compared to those close to college (50%).
2. Despite being farther, people with this higher educational attainment also have a higher probability of high salary (53%) than those closer (64%), suggesting the education level is beneficial.
3. The comparison suggests that having a degree increases the chance of a high salary, as far residents with higher degrees show better economic outcomes."
37,no,"The probability of having a healthy heart without medication (45%) is higher than with medication (28%). Therefore, it's more likely for a person to have a healthy heart if they are not on medication."
38,no,"1. Without medication: Low BP (48%) < High BP (77%), indicating high BP is better without medication. 2. With medication: Low BP (20%) < High BP (46%), and both probabilities are lower than their respective counterparts without medication, suggesting medication negatively impacts heart health."
39,yes,"The probability of a prisoner's death is 75% when executed by a captain and 32% when released. Therefore, for a captain who executes prisoners, the likelihood of seeing the prisoner's death would be lessened if the captain had chosen to release them instead."
40,yes,"Calculated P(Normal Weight | Smoking) = 17% / 34% = 50%. Given P(Normal Weight | Non-Smoking) = 8%, compared these probabilities, and found that P(Normal Weight | Smoking) > P(Normal Weight | Non-Smoking)."
41,no,"1. The statement suggests that old age and high hospital bill lead to recovery.
2. We observe an old patient.
3. If this old patient has a low hospital bill instead of a high one, it does not meet the specified condition for recovery.
4. Therefore, based on the given conditions, the patient may not recover with a low hospital bill."
42,no,"A correlation coefficient of -0.16 indicates a very weak negative relationship between talent and being hard-working among elite institution students but does not imply causation. The correlation's weakness suggests minimal impact, and other factors or chance could be influencing the results."
43,no,"Method 1 provides a broad view of personality-appearance correlation but ignores specific contexts like relationship status. Method 2 offers detailed insights by considering relationship status, capturing nuances that Method 1 misses. Thus, for understanding the nuanced effects of personality on appearance, Method 2 is more correct."
44,yes,Calculate overall arrival probability (44% + 4%) and conditional arrival probability given waking up late (4%/5%). Compare these probabilities. The conditional probability (80%) is higher than the overall probability (48%).
45,no,"Calculate P(Fired) as (Probability of signing * Probability of being fired if signed) + (Probability of not signing * Probability of being fired if not signed). The probabilities given are: 0.28 for signing, 0.49 for being fired if signed, 0.72 for not signing, and 0.92 for being fired if not signed. P(Fired) = (0.28 * 0.49) + (0.72 * 0.92) = 0.1372 + 0.6624 = 0.7996 or 79.96%. The probability of not being fired is then 1 - P(Fired) = 1 - 0.7996 = 0.2004 or 20.04%, which is less than the probability of being fired."
46,no,"Method 1 provides a broad overview of medication's impact on heart conditions but may miss individual nuances. Method 2, focusing on case-by-case blood pressure analysis, allows for more detailed insights and targeted treatments based on specific physiological conditions. Thus, Method 2 offers a more precise understanding in personalized contexts."
47,yes,"We calculate P(Recovery|Treatment) by dividing the probability of receiving treatment and recovering by the overall probability of receiving treatment, which gives us approximately 0.70. Similarly, we find P(Recovery|No Treatment) by dividing the probability of not receiving treatment and recovering by the overall probability of not receiving treatment, resulting in approximately 0.26. Since 0.70 is greater than 0.26, recovery chance is higher when receiving treatment."
48,no,"1) The confounding factor being inactive means the person did not likely get a college degree due to proximity to the college. 2) However, if they still have a college degree or higher education (irrespective of how it was acquired), the second relationship indicates they should expect a high salary. 3) Therefore, if this person has a college degree or higher, they are not expected to have a low salary."
49,no,"Method 1 provides a generalized view of the correlation between husband and alarm clock, while Method 2 offers personalized insights based on each wife's relationship. The correct method depends on whether general trends or specific dynamics are more relevant to the research question."
50,yes,"Method 1 uses a generalized approach to evaluate the correlation between appearance and talent across various cases, minimizing biases such as selection, halo, and confirmation. This method aims to capture a broad, reliable pattern in data. In contrast, Method 2 focuses on famous individuals, which can introduce bias and may not represent the overall relationship accurately due to the selective nature of fame."
51,yes,"Method 1 provides a detailed look at how education affects salaries based on specific skills, capturing variation across different jobs. Method 2 offers a broad overview that may not capture these nuances, leading to less accurate insights about the relationship between education and salary."
52,no,"1. Calculate overall probability of recovery: P(Recover) = P(No Treatment and Recover) + P(Treatment and Recover) = 28% + 20% = 48%. 
2. Find the conditional probability of recovery given treatment: P(Recover|Treatment) = P(Treatment and Recover) / P(Treatment) = 20%/55% ≈ 36.36%. 
3. Compare probabilities: Overall recovery rate (48%) > Recovery rate with treatment (36.36%)."
53,yes,"Calculate the probabilities for increased and reduced prices by considering both scenarios of supply changes (increased or reduced) and their respective impacts on price changes. Sum the probabilities of increased prices across both scenarios to compare with the probability of a reduced price. The total probability of an increased price is 58.06%, which is higher than the probability of a reduced price, which is 41.94%."
54,no,"1. Calculate P(M): probability of taking medication, which is given as 0.91. 2. Given P(~M ∩ Healthy Heart) = 0.03 and P(M ∩ Healthy Heart) = 0.23. 3. Compute P(Healthy Heart | Taking Medication) using the formula: P(M ∩ Healthy Heart) / P(M), which equals approximately 0.2527 or 25.27%. 4. Calculate overall P(Healthy Heart): sum of probabilities for all scenarios where heart is healthy, i.e., P(M ∩ Healthy Heart) + P(~M ∩ Healthy Heart) = 0.26 or 26%. 5. Compare the calculated values: P(Healthy Heart | Taking Medication) ≈ 25.27% and P(Healthy Heart) = 26%, indicating a slightly higher chance of having a healthy heart when not specifically observing medication."
55,yes,"Calculate the probability of waking up on time (91%) and combine it with the given probabilities for being on time when awake (37%) and late (71%). The total probability of arriving on time is 0.4046, which is greater than 50%."
56,no,"The probability of scurvy is lower for those who consume citrus (65%) compared to those who do not (82%). Since scurvy is caused by vitamin C deficiency and citrus fruits are rich in vitamin C, consuming citrus should reduce the risk of scurvy."
57,no,"Calculate P(H|M) as 5% / 13% ≈ 0.3846 or 38.46%, and P(H|NM) as 41% / 87% ≈ 0.4713 or 47.13%. Since P(H|NM) > P(H|M), the chance of high salary is not larger when observing male gender."
58,no,The probability of penguin death is the same (53%) for both using the stairs and the elevator. There is no difference in risk between the two options.
59,no,"The problem involves calculating the overall probability of having an attractive appearance based on given conditional probabilities and personality types. Since both mean and kind individuals share the same 11% chance of being attractive, we use the law of total probability with their respective probabilities (5% for mean, 95% for kind) to find that the overall probability of being attractive is 11%. This is less than the probability of not being attractive (89%), indicating that an unattractive appearance is more likely overall."
60,no,"Method 1 provides a broad correlation between education and salary without controlling for other influential factors (unobserved confounders), whereas Method 2 seeks to isolate the effect of education on salary by accounting for these unobserved confounders. Thus, Method 2 offers a more accurate understanding of the relationship."
61,no,"Method 1 fails to consider variations in department competitiveness, whereas Method 2 accounts for these differences by examining admissions case by case. This makes Method 2 more precise and contextually relevant for understanding the impact of gender on admission status across different departments."
62,yes,"The probability of having a long lifespan is higher for normal weight individuals (85%) than for obese individuals (64%). If an individual transitions from being normal weight to obese, their likelihood of a long lifespan decreases due to the change in category and its associated lower probability."
63,no,"1. Reduced crop yield increases the probability of increased prices (40%); increased crop yield decreases this probability (26%). 2. Increased crop yield is associated with a higher probability of increased supply (72%) compared to reduced crop yield (38%). 3. Since increased crop yield (leading to increased supply) correlates with lower probabilities of price increase, it suggests that an increased supply does not lead to a higher chance of increased prices."
64,yes,Calculate the weighted average probability of acceptance for individuals who are not male and those who are male based on their residency status and department competitiveness probabilities. Compare these averages to determine if gender affects admission status negatively.
65,no,"The chain-smoker lighting a match is enough to cause the forest fire; hence, the camper's action (or inaction) regarding lighting a match is irrelevant to the outcome."
66,yes,"Calculate P(arriving on time) as 63% by summing probabilities of arriving on time under both conditions. Then, calculate the conditional probability P(arriving on time | waking up late) ≈ 49.20%. Since 49.20% is less than the overall probability of arriving on time (63%), the chance of arriving to school on time is smaller when observing that someone wakes up late."
67,no,"For small kidney stones, treatment slightly decreases the chance of recovery from 95% to 83%. For large kidney stones, treatment drastically decreases the chance of recovery from 20% to 9%. Given that there's a 41% chance of having a large kidney stone and only a 59% chance of having a small one, the negative impact on large stones outweighs the slight positive effect on small ones. Therefore, treatment generally decreases overall chances of recovery."
68,yes,"The analysis compares probabilities of high infant mortality across different scenarios involving maternal smoking and birth weight. The data shows that birth weight significantly reduces infant mortality for both nonsmokers (85% vs 50%) and smokers (81% vs 56%). However, the gap is narrower for smokers compared to nonsmokers, indicating that maternal smoking has an additional negative impact on reducing high infant mortality even when the birth weight is normal. Additionally, the overall probabilities of high infant mortality are slightly higher for smokers (69.34%) compared to nonsmokers (67.25%), supporting the notion that maternal smoking increases infant mortality. The data also indicates that maternal smoking affects the likelihood of having a normal birth weight, which further influences mortality rates."
69,yes,"Method 1 provides a detailed analysis by considering the impact of hospital costs on recovery for different age groups, whereas Method 2 offers a broad overview without accounting for specific patient characteristics. This makes Method 1 more accurate for understanding the relationship between hospital costs and recovery."
70,yes,"Calculate the conditional probability of cholera given clean water (23%/65%) and compare it to the conditional probability of cholera given polluted water (24%/35%). Since 35.38% < 68.57%, the chance of cholera contraction is smaller when observing clean water."
71,no,"The probability of wet ground in the rainy season (38%) is lower than that in the dry season (41%). Therefore, it would not be more likely to see wet ground during a rainy season regardless of whether the previous season was dry. The given probabilities are current-season statistics and do not depend on prior seasons."
72,no,"Citrus intake reduces the probability of scurvy from 54% in non-consumers to 24% in consumers, hence not increasing but decreasing the chance of scurvy."
73,no,"The probability of having an intelligent child increases slightly more for children with high social status when their parents are already intelligent compared to unintelligent parents. However, the increase in probability (3 percentage points) is minimal and inconsistent with the decrease seen among unintelligent parents' children (4 percentage points decrease). This suggests that while parental intelligence and social status both play a role, social status does not significantly mediate the relationship between parental and child intelligence."
74,no,"Calculated recovery rates show that individuals without pre-conditions have a higher recovery rate without vaccination (96%) compared to with it (76%), and those with pre-conditions also fare worse if they refuse the vaccine (25%) than if they get it (4%). However, when considering an overall population weighted by the probability of having pre-conditions, the chance of recovering from the disease is higher without vaccination (57.66%) compared to getting vaccinated (37.12%)."
75,yes,"1. High cigarette tax decreases likelihood of maternal smoking; low increases it.
2. Both confounder activity and maternal smoking can independently cause normal birth weight.
3. Presence of active confounders might offset negative impacts of smoking or contribute positively to birth weight.
4. Given both factors are present (low cigarette tax, high confounder activity), it is plausible that the infant could still have a normal birth weight despite maternal smoking."
76,no,Calculate the conditional probability of survival given vaccination and lack thereof using the provided data; compare both probabilities to determine which scenario offers a higher chance of survival.
77,yes,"We calculate the overall probability of arriving on time by summing the probabilities of waking up on time and arriving on time (43%) and waking up late but still arriving on time (1%), resulting in a 44% overall chance. The conditional probability of arriving on time given that one wakes up late is 50%, calculated by dividing the probability of waking up late and arriving on time (1%) by the probability of waking up late (2%). Since 50% is greater than 44%, the chance of arriving on time is indeed higher when waking up late."
78,no,"1. Compare the probability of high salary for not males vs males across both blue-collar and white-collar jobs; observe that not males have higher probabilities in both cases (31% vs 25% for blue-collar, 62% vs 60% for white-collar).
2. Examine the relationship between skill level and probability of white-collar job for both genders; note an increase with skill levels but no significant gender influence.
3. Conclude that gender negatively affects salary through occupation based on higher probabilities of high salaries among not males in both blue-collar and white-collar jobs."
79,yes,"1. People not on medication have a 68% chance of a healthy heart.
2. People on medication have a 40% chance of a healthy heart.
3. Since 40% is less than 68%, taking medication decreases the probability of having a healthy heart."
80,no,"Method 1 offers a general correlation without accounting for poverty, which could be a significant confounding variable affecting both water quality and cholera incidence. Method 2 controls for poverty by examining correlations case-by-case, allowing for a more accurate isolation of the effects of water quality on cholera."
81,no,"The probability of tanned skin for people not using tanning salon treatments (74%) is higher than the probability for those who did go to tanning salons (30%). Therefore, tanning salon treatment decreases the chance of having tanned skin."
82,no,"The question presents conflicting probability values. Ignoring inconsistencies, when managers sign termination letters, the probability of firing is 31%, while it can be as high as 85% when they do not. This suggests that manager signing likely decreases the chance of an employee being fired."
83,yes,"Calculate the joint probability of an alarm ringing given it's set and not set, then compare this to the joint probability of an alarm being silent in both scenarios. The probability of a ring P(Ring) = (0.86 * 0.81) + (0.21 * 0.19), and the probability of silence P(Silence) = (0.14 * 0.81) + (0.79 * 0.19)."
84,no,Method 1 offers a general view of the correlation between obesity and lifespan without considering specific factors like diabetes. Method 2 focuses on how diabetes affects this correlation. The choice depends on whether you want an overall picture (Method 1) or insights into the role of diabetes (Method 2).
85,yes,"1. Calculate P(High|Encouragement) as 7% / 10% = 70%.
2. Assume remaining probabilities sum to 90% for not receiving encouragement, with x and y representing probabilities of low score with encouragement and high score without encouragement respectively.
3. Given the higher probability (28%) of a high score when discouraged compared to when encouraged (7%), it suggests P(High|Not Encouragement) > 70%.
4. Therefore, chance of high exam score is smaller when observing encouragement."
86,yes,"1. Males without treatment do not recover. 2. The patient is male. 3. If the patient does not receive treatment, he will follow the pattern of males who do not recover."
87,yes,"Calculate the overall probability of taking all assigned drugs (P(All Drugs) = 0.29). Determine P(No Drugs) as 1 - P(All Drugs) = 0.71. Use given conditional probabilities: P(Low Cholesterol | No Drugs) = 0.67 and P(Low Cholesterol | All Drugs) = 0.49. Apply the law of total probability to find P(Low Cholesterol) = P(All Drugs) * P(Low Cholesterol | All Drugs) + P(No Drugs) * P(Low Cholesterol | No Drugs). Compute P(Low Cholesterol) as 0.5308. Calculate P(High Cholesterol) as 1 - P(Low Cholesterol) = 0.4692. Since 0.5308 > 0.4692, low cholesterol is more likely."
88,yes,"Calculate the weighted average probabilities for each combination of parent intelligence and confounder status to determine the overall probability of an intelligent child without considering parental social status as a mediator. The probability of an intelligent child given intelligent parents (75.3%) is higher than the probability given unintelligent parents (46.9%), indicating that parents' intelligence positively affects a child's intelligence when disregarding the mediation effect through parental social status."
89,no,"The probability of smallpox survival for unvaccinated individuals (51%) is higher than that for vaccinated individuals (40%). Hence, if we consider a vaccinated person, their likelihood of surviving smallpox would be less based on these statistics."
90,no,"The relationship established is between assignment to drug treatment (and having an active confounder) with taking all assigned drugs leading to low cholesterol. There's no direct link provided for how an active confounder affects cholesterol levels in the absence of drugs. Thus, we can't conclude the patient would have low cholesterol without taking any drugs."
91,no,"The probability of the forest catching fire is 75% without lighting a match and decreases to 59% when a camper lights a match. Therefore, lighting a match reduces the chance of the forest catching fire."
92,yes,"1) Large kidney stones require treatment for recovery.
2) The patient has been observed to have a large kidney stone.
3) Receiving treatment leads to recovery while not receiving treatment does not provide the same outcome.
4) Therefore, the patient is expected to recover if they receive treatment instead of no treatment."
93,yes,The probability of high salary among those with a college degree or higher (52%) is compared to the probability of high salary among those with a high school degree or lower (2%). The comparison shows that the chance of a high salary is significantly larger for those with a college degree or higher.
94,no,"Method 1 provides a general overview but ignores unobserved confounders, while Method 2 accounts for these by analyzing case by case. For a more accurate understanding of the direct effect, Method 2 is generally preferable over Method 1."
95,yes,"1. A burning candle produces light, not darkness. 2. Blowing out a candle extinguishes the flame by removing oxygen, causing it to stop producing light. 3. If a candle runs out of wax without being blown out, the flame will naturally go out as there's no fuel left for combustion. 4. In both scenarios—whether you blow out the candle or it burns down on its own—the result is that the candle stops producing light, making the room darker if the candle was the only source of illumination."
96,no,"Compare the probability of high salary for each group: 28% for college degree or higher and 14% for high school degree or lower. Since 28% > 14%, having a college degree or higher is associated with a higher chance of a high salary, not a smaller one."
97,no,"The initial statements contain a logical inconsistency. Given this, we focus on the direct relationship between poor maternal health and increased infant mortality risks. Despite being nonsmoking, poor health in the mother still increases infant mortality risk due to potential pregnancy and childbirth complications, though potentially not as high as if she were smoking."
98,no,"1. Infants of nonsmokers have a 62% chance of high infant mortality.
2. Infants of smokers have a 74% chance of high infant mortality.
3. A higher probability indicates greater likelihood.
4. Therefore, if an infant has a smoking mother, switching to a nonsmoking mother would lower the likelihood of high infant mortality from 74% to 62%."
99,no,"Method 2 evaluates overall vaccination status and survival correlation, providing clarity on vaccine efficacy. Method 1's individual case analysis adds complexity and potential bias without significantly enhancing the understanding of vaccine effects."
