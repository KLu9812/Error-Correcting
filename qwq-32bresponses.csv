0,yes,Obese without diabetes: 62% vs normal weight without diabetes:32% → Obesity increases lifespan chance. Obese with diabetes:81% vs normal with diabetes:60% → Obesity still increases. Both cases show positive association when ignoring diabetes mediation.
1,yes,"Tar contains carcinogens that damage DNA, leading to mutations causing uncontrolled cell growth. Smokers have higher lung cancer rates (49% vs 26%), indicating causation."
2,no,"Non-males: 78% admission rate vs Males: 67%. Since 78% > 67%, male has lower chance. Thus, male gender decreases probability."
3,no,"Smokers' overall lung cancer probability (considering tar deposits) is ~63%, while nonsmokers have ~50%. Since 63% > 50%, smoking increases the likelihood. Therefore, no."
4,yes,"The probability of lung cancer for smokers (65.54%) and nonsmokers (65.76%) is nearly identical when considering their respective probabilities of having high or low tar deposits. The slight numerical difference isn't statistically significant, so smokers aren’t meaningfully less likely than nonsmokers in this scenario."
5,yes,"1. Nonsmokers: 53% admission rate vs Smokers: 27%. 2. Lower percentage for smokers suggests association. 3. Possible confounders, but data shows lower probability."
6,yes,"Calculate P(accepted | Male): 32%/83% ≈ 38.55%. Calculate P(accepted | Non-Male): 11%/ (100%-83%) = 11%/17% ≈64.7%. Since 38.55% < 64.7%, males have a lower acceptance rate."
7,no,Method 1 allows analysis of gender-specific effects but risks lower statistical power due to smaller sample sizes in subgroups. Method 2 provides a general overview with higher power but may miss gender differences. The correct choice depends on whether the study aims to explore subgroup (gender) effects or just overall effectiveness.
8,yes,"1. Calculate average child intelligence for unintelligent and intelligent parents, ignoring social status.
2. Unintelligent parents: (89% + 86%) / 2 ≈ 87.5%
3. Intelligent parents: (45% + 47%) / 2 ≈ 46%
4. Since intelligent parents have lower average child intelligence, the effect is negative when mediation is disregarded."
9,no,"Scurvy is caused by a lack of Vitamin C. Citrus contains high levels of this vitamin. The lower probability (16%) of scurvy in citrus consumers versus non-consumers (27%) indicates that citrus consumption reduces the risk, as the vitamin combats deficiency. Therefore, citrus does not negatively affect scurvy but helps prevent it."
10,yes,"1. Calculate female's total admission probability by weighting their competitive and non-competitive applications: 75% *70% +25%*17%=56.75%. 
2. Calculate males' total admission probability similarly:14% *51%+86% *8%=14.02%. Since females have higher overall admission rate, gender positively affects admissions for non-males over males when ignoring department competitiveness."
11,yes,"When husbands don’t set alarms, wives compensate (74% chance), resulting in a 54% alarm probability. When husbands do set alarms, wives contribute less (24%), reducing the combined success rate to 41%, which is lower than when only the wife acts (54%). The husband’s action discourages the wife’s contribution, leading to an overall negative effect on the alarm ringing probability."
12,yes,Execution leads to higher death probability (65%) compared to release (21%). Switching from execution to release reduces likelihood of death.
13,no,"To determine if the prisoner's chance of death is smaller given an execution order: 1. Calculate P(Death | Execute) = P(Execute ∧ Death)/P(Execute) = 15%/18% ≈ 83%. 2. Compare with other scenarios, such as P(Death | Release). Here, P(Release)=82%, so P(Death | Release) = 27%/82%≈32.9%. Since 83% > 32.9%, death is more likely when Execute is ordered than not. Thus, the chance isn't smaller."
14,no,"The question requires comparing P(High Salary | College Degree) and P(High Salary | No College Degree). However, the given probabilities are conditioned on proximity to a college (far/close), not directly on degree status. Since we lack information about how degree status relates to location or overall population distributions, we can't compute the necessary conditional probabilities. Thus, it's impossible to determine if a college degree increases high salary chances with the provided data."
15,no,"Confounder inactive (C=0) implies assignment to treatment is also inactive (A=0). If T was set to 1 under A=0, it means taking all assigned drugs when none were assigned—effectively no change. Thus, only C=0 affects L. Since both required causes for low cholesterol are not present, the answer is No."
16,yes,"Confounding variables can bias results. Method 1 tries to account for them but requires proper handling of unobserved variables. If unobserved confounders exist and are addressed effectively in Method 1, it is more correct. However, if they aren’t properly managed or don't significantly affect results, Method 2 might suffice."
17,no,"The probabilities show higher salary and higher education rates among people close to colleges. Since proximity likely correlates with access to education and better job opportunities, having a degree is associated with higher salaries in this context, not lower ones."
18,no,"1. Calculate P(Death|Elevator) = 2% / 10% = 20%
2. Calculate P(Death|Stairs) = 66% / 90% ≈73%
3. Compare: 20% < 73%, so the chance is smaller when taking elevator."
19,yes,"Calculate total P(Long) as (0.44*0.09)+(0.6*0.91)=0.5856 (~58.56%). Since this exceeds 50%, long lifespan is more likely overall."
20,no,"Calculated total recovery probability as (0.5*0.6)+(0.5*0.39)=0.495 (49.5%). Non-recovery is 1 - 0.495 = 50.5%. Thus, non-recovery is more likely overall."
21,yes,"Total probability of high salary = (Male % * Male High Salary) + (Non-Male % * Non-Male High Salary). Plugging in the numbers: (83%*40%) + (17%*19%) ≈ 33.2% + 3.23% ≈ 36.4%. Since 36.4% <50%, high salary is less likely than low."
22,no,"1. Calculate P(C|P)=8/17≈47%. 2. Calculate P(C|¬P)=73/83≈88%. 3. Since 88%>47%, the chance of intelligent child is lower with intelligent parents."
23,no,"1. Captain's order changes from execute to release. 2. Corporal and private follow orders; no shooting occurs. 3. Without any shootings, prisoner survives."
24,yes,"Choosing stairs leads to lower penguin happiness (55%) with higher death probabilities in both moods compared to elevator choice. Elevator increases happiness (92%), lowering the overall death rate because most penguins are happy (1% death) and even sad ones have better survival than stairs-sad penguins. Hence, decision positively impacts survival via mood."
25,yes,"Given that P(smoking gene)=3%, and among non-smoking genes, 50% have lung cancer (P(lung cancer | no smoking gene)=50%). Among those with the smoking gene, only 2% have lung cancer. Thus, having the smoking gene is associated with a lower probability of lung cancer."
26,no,"For all groups (with or without pre-conditions), vaccinated individuals have higher recovery probabilities than their unvaccinated counterparts. Therefore, getting the vaccine increases recovery chances."
27,yes,"The vaccine reduces infection probability (e.g., 95% effective) but has a lower survival rate if infected (33%) compared to unvaccinated (42%). Total survival for vaccinated includes both avoiding infection entirely and surviving if infected. Using formula: Survival = Efficacy * 1 + (1 - Efficacy)*SurvivalRateIfInfected. Plugging in numbers gives vaccinated ~96.6% survival vs. unvaccinated's 42%. Thus, vaccination positively impacts overall survival despite lower post-infection survival."
28,yes,"High poverty + poor water company → polluted water. High poverty + polluted water → cholera. If clean water replaces polluted water, then even with high poverty, the contaminated water factor is eliminated. Thus, avoiding polluted water reduces cholera risk."
29,yes,"1. Analyze probabilities of high salary by gender and occupation.
2. For both blue-collar and white-collar jobs, non-male workers have higher probabilities (31% vs 25% for blue-collar; 62% vs 60% for white-collar).
3. Since the question asks to disregard mediation through occupation, we focus on gender differences within each occupation.
4. In both occupations, being non-male is associated with a higher chance of high salary compared to males.
5. Therefore, gender has a positive direct effect on salary when occupation's mediating role is ignored."
30,yes,"Calculate total probability of high score by combining probabilities from both encouraged and not encouraged groups. Encouraged contribute ~31.92% (0.76*0.42), non-encouraged add ~18.56% (0.32*0.58). Total ≈50.48%, which exceeds 50%. Thus, high scores are more likely."
31,no,"The probabilities given are all conditional on both the decision (stairs/elevator) and penguin mood. Since we need to disregard penguin mood's mediating effect, but no direct survival rates for each decision exist without considering mood, there’s insufficient data to determine a direct impact. Hence, the answer is no."
32,no,"Compare the given probabilities: P(Normal|Smoking)=17%, P(Normal|Non-smoking)=19%. Since 17% < 19%, the probability is higher for non-smokers."
33,no,"1. Given probabilities: P(S)=0.19, P(¬S∩F)=0.21, P(S∩F)=0.12.
2. Calculate P(F|S) = 0.12 / 0.19 ≈ 63.16%.
3. Total P(F) = 0.12 + 0.21 = 33%.
4. Since 63.16% > 33%, observing S increases the chance of F."
34,no,"The correlation of -0.04 is very weak and close to zero, indicating no significant linear association between respiratory issues and broken bones. Since correlation does not equal causation, this does not prove that one causes the other. Therefore, it's unlikely respiratory issues directly affect broken bones based on this data."
35,yes,"1. In-state residency alone ensures a competitive department.
2. Admission requires either male/in-state + competitive dept, which in this case are met by in-state status plus the resulting competitive dept.
3. Changing gender to non-male removes one cause but leaves in-state as sufficient for both conditions."
36,no,"People far from colleges have higher degrees (80%) but lower high-salary rates (53%). Those closer have fewer degrees (50%) yet higher salaries (64%). This inverse relationship suggests other factors like location affect salary, so the data doesn't confirm if college degrees directly increase salary chances."
37,yes,"People not on meds have 45% healthy heart chance vs. 28% for those on meds. The lower probability when on medication suggests that, counterfactually, if they weren't taking it, their likelihood might be higher (45%). However, this assumes causation isn’t reversed by factors like pre-existing conditions requiring medication."
38,no,"1. Calculate the expected healthy heart probabilities for those on and off medications using their respective probabilities of high/low BP and heart health rates. 2. Without meds: (0.63×48%) + (0.37×77%) ≈58.7%. With meds: (0.4×20%)+(0.6×46%)≈35.6%. 3. Medication reduces expected probability, suggesting negative effect."
39,yes,"Execution leads to 75% death probability; releasing reduces it to 32%, so release makes death less likely."
40,yes,"1. P(Smoker) = 0.34; so P(Non-Smoker)=0.66
2. Given: P(Normal ∩ Non-Smoker)=0.08 → P(Normal|Non)=0.08/0.66 ≈12.1%
3. Given: P(Smoker ∩ Normal)=0.17 → P(Normal|Smoker)=0.17/0.34 = 50%
4. Since 50% > 12%, the chance is larger for smokers"
41,yes,"Old age causes low bills and requires high bills with old age for recovery. Since patient is old (low bill), missing high bill means no recovery."
42,no,"1. The given correlation coefficient (-0.16) is weak and negative.
2. Correlation does not establish causation; it only shows a statistical association.
3. A negative correlation suggests an inverse relationship but doesn’t prove talent causes changes in work ethic or vice versa.
4. Additional research (e.g., controlling variables, experiments) is needed to confirm causality."
43,no,Method 1 identifies broad trends but may miss subgroup nuances; Method 2 captures variability in subgroups but requires more data and risks overfitting. Correctness depends on the research goal: general patterns vs. subgroup specifics.
44,no,"1. P(Late) = 5%. 
2. P(OnTimeWake ∩ OnTimeArrive)=44%, P(Late∩OnTimeArrive)=4%.
3. Total P(OnTimeArrive)=44% +4%=48%.
4. Compare P(OnTimeArrive | Late)=4% vs total 48%. Since 4% <48%, arriving on time is less likely when late."
45,no,"Calculate total fire probability by combining both scenarios: (0.28*0.49)+(0.72*0.92) ≈ 0.1372 + 0.6624 = 0.7996 (≈80%). Since this exceeds 50%, being fired is more likely."
46,no,"Method 1 assesses the overall correlation between medication and heart conditions without considering blood pressure variations. Method 2 analyzes the correlation within specific blood pressure subgroups. Since blood pressure significantly influences heart health and medication effects can vary by subgroup, aggregating all data (Method 1) risks missing important interactions or misleading average results. Thus, Method 2 is more correct for precise analysis."
47,yes,"Given P(T)=69%, P(¬T∧R)=8%, and P(T∧R)=48%. Calculated conditional probabilities: P(R|T)≈69.57% and P(R|¬T)≈25.81%. Since 69.57% > 25.81%, recovery chance is higher with treatment."
48,no,"1. Confounder inactive and close to college do not cause college degree due to confounder's state. 
2. If the person has a college degree despite the confounder being inactive, then according to 'college degree or higher causes high salary', they should have a high salary.
3. Therefore, even with an inactive confounder, having a college degree directly leads to high salary, so the answer is no (they wouldn't have low salary)."
49,no,1. Method 1 ignores confounding variables like the wife. 2. Method 2 controls for the wife's influence. 3. Controlling variables leads to a more precise understanding of direct effects.
50,no,"Method 1 provides a general correlation but may overlook context like fame's influence. Method 2 accounts for fame in specific cases but might lack broader applicability. Since the question focuses on appearance affecting talent without emphasizing fame, Method 1 is foundational, but Method 2 could be more accurate if fame impacts the relationship, making Method 1 potentially less correct."
51,yes,"Method 1 adjusts for skill as a potential confounding variable, which can reveal true relationships by avoiding Simpson's paradox. If skills influence both education and salary, not accounting for them (Method 2) may obscure the actual effect. Therefore, Method 1 is more correct when confounding variables like skill are present."
52,no,"1. Given P(Treatment)=0.55, so P(No Treatment)=0.45
2. P(Recovery | Treatment) = 0.20 / 0.55 ≈ 36.36%
3. P(Recovery | No Treatment)=0.28 / 0.45≈62.22%
4. Since 62.22% > 36.36%, the chance of recovery is higher without treatment."
53,yes,"Calculate total probability of increased prices by combining both scenarios (reduced and increased supply). Increased price occurs with 72% when supply increases (59%) and 38% when supply decreases (41%). Total: (0.59×0.72)+(0.41×0.38)=58.06%. The probability of reduced prices is the remaining scenarios where prices don’t increase, which sums to ~41.94%. Since 58%>41%, increased price is more likely."
54,no,"Given probabilities show that P(H|¬M) ≈ 33.3% and P(H|M) ≈25.27%. Since 33.3% > 25%, chance of healthy heart is larger when not taking medication, so the answer is no."
55,no,"1. Calculate total P(Arrive On Time):
   - P(Woke OT)*P(Arrive OT|Woke OT) = 0.91*0.37 ≈ 0.3367
   - P(Woke Late)*P(Arrive OT|Woke Late)=0.09*0.71≈0.0639
   - Total: ≈0.4006 (40.06%)
2. P(Arrive Late) = 1 - 0.4006 ≈59.94%
3. Since 59.94% > 40.06%, arriving late is more likely overall."
56,no,"Scurvy is caused by vitamin C deficiency. Citrus provides vitamin C, so consuming it should lower scurvy risk. However, the given probabilities show higher scurvy rates in citrus consumers (82% vs 65%). This inconsistency suggests confounding variables like reverse causation (people with scurvy eat more citrus) or other dietary issues, not that citrus causes harm. The data doesn't prove causation."
57,no,"Male conditional probability: 5%/13% ≈ 38.46%. Non-male conditional probability: 41%/87% ≈ 47.13%. Since 47.13% > 38.46%, higher chance with non-male."
58,no,"1. Stairs: 53% death probability
2. Elevator: 53% death probability
3. Both options have identical probabilities
4. No change in chance between the two"
59,no,"Overall attractiveness is calculated by combining both groups (kind and mean). Since both have 11% chance, regardless of their proportions, the total remains 11%, making unattractive (89%) more likely."
60,no,"1. The goal is to determine if Method 1 (direct correlation) or Method 2 (controlling for unobserved confounders) better assesses the effect of education on salary. 2. Unobserved variables like innate ability can bias the direct correlation in Method 1. 3. Method 2 aims to isolate the true causal relationship by accounting for these hidden factors, yielding a more accurate estimate. 4. However, since unobserved confounders are not measurable, Method 2 may be theoretically preferable but practically challenging. 5. Assuming both methods are theoretical and unobserved variables exist, controlling them (Method 2) is more correct to understand causality."
61,no,"Simpson's Paradox can reverse trends when data is aggregated vs grouped. If gender correlates with department choice and departments have different admission rates, Method1 (overall view) may show bias where there isn’t any or vice versa. Method2 adjusts for department competitiveness, providing a fairer assessment of gender’s direct effect on admissions independent of department choice."
62,yes,"The probabilities provided show that normal weight people have an 85% chance vs 64% for obese individuals. Since 64% is less than 85%, obesity correlates with reduced likelihood of long lifespan."
63,no,"Increased yield causes higher supply (72%) but lower chances of price increase (26%). Reduced yield leads to lower supply (38%) but higher price chance (40%). Thus, increased supply correlates with lower price probability. Therefore, NO."
64,yes,"Calculate average admission rates for each gender across departments: Non-males have (66 + 91)/2 = 78.5%; males have (42 + 61)/2 = 51.5%. Since non-males' average is higher, gender negatively impacts admissions."
65,yes,"1. The problem states that either action (camper or chain-smoker) can cause fire.
2. In this scenario, only the chain-smoker lights a match.
3. Since a single match from either person can ignite the forest,
4. The forest still burns down because the chain-smoker's match is enough."
66,yes,"The question asks whether arriving on time is less likely when waking up late. To find this, compare P(Arrive On Time | Late) with P(Arrive On Time). Calculate P(Arrive On Time | Late) as (31%) / 63% ≈ 49%. Since the overall probability of arriving on time includes both scenarios (waking up on time and late), we compute total Arrive On Time = 32% + 31% = 63%. Therefore, conditional probability given waking late is ~49%, which is lower than the total 63%, meaning yes."
67,no,"1. Calculate probabilities for treated vs untreated overall:
   - Untreated: (0.59×0.95)+(0.41×0.2)=64.25%
   - Treated: (0.59×0.83)+(0.41×0.09)=52.86%
2. Since 52.86% < 64.25%, treatment reduces recovery chances overall."
68,no,"1. Compare infant mortality between smoking and non-smoking mothers within each birth weight category.
2. For low birth weight: Smokers (81%) vs Non-smokers (85%) → Smokers have slightly lower mortality.
3. For normal birth weight: Smokers (56%) vs Non-smokers (50%) → Smokers have higher mortality here but still comparable to non-smoker's 50%.
4. Since mortality is not consistently higher in smoking across both categories, smoking doesn’t positively influence mortality via birth weight; instead, it shows mixed effects which don't support a positive mediation."
69,yes,"Method 1 accounts for possible interactions between age and hospital cost effects, providing subgroup-specific insights. If age significantly influences how costs affect recovery, Method 1 is better to capture varying relationships. Method 2 ignores such nuances but requires less data complexity. Thus, Method 1 is more correct when age moderates the relationship."
70,yes,"The probabilities given are joint probabilities: P(Clean ∩ Cholera)=23% and P(Polluted ∩ Cholera)=24%. To find conditional probabilities: P(Cholera|Clean) = 23/65 ≈ 35.4%, while P(Cholera|Polluted)=24/35≈68.6%. Since 35.4% < 68.6%, the chance of cholera is smaller with clean water."
71,yes,"Dry season has 41% chance of wet ground vs rainy season's 38%. Since 41% > 38%, it would be more likely in the dry season. The question seems to ask if switching from rainy to dry season increases likelihood, which is yes."
72,no,Citrus provides vitamin C which prevents scurvy. Non-consumers have 54% scurvy probability vs consumers' 24%. Lower probability in consumers means lower risk.
73,no,"Parental intelligence increases the likelihood of high social status. For unintelligent parents, higher status slightly reduces child IQ probability (39%→35%), while for intelligent parents, higher status slightly improves it (65%→68%). Since parental intelligence also directly raises child IQ chances, and the indirect effect via status is mixed but overall not negative when considering both groups' contributions, there's no net negative effect through social status."
74,no,"1. Calculate overall recovery rates by combining pre and no-pre groups weighted by their probabilities.
Unvaccinated: (0.46×96%) + (0.54×25%) = ~57.66%
Vaccinated: (0.46×76%) + (0.54×4%) = ~37.12%
Conclusion: Vaccinated has lower recovery rate than unvaccinated overall."
75,yes,"1. The problem states that an active confounder or a smoking mother leads to normal infant birth weight.
2. In the observed scenario, the confounder is active (regardless of cigarette tax).
3. Since the presence of either condition (confounder or smoking) ensures normal birth weight,
4. even switching from non-smoking to smoking mother while keeping the confounder active does not change the outcome."
76,no,"Survival rate without vaccination: 1%; Survival rate with vaccination: 52%. Since 52% > 1%, vaccination increases survival chances. Therefore, observing vaccination corresponds to higher survival probability, so the chance of survival is not smaller but larger when vaccinated."
77,yes,"Total arrival on time probability = 43% +1% =44%. The conditional probability given waking up late is (1% /2%)=50%, which is higher than 44%"
78,yes,"1. Males have a higher probability of being in white-collar jobs at both skill levels compared to non-males (e.g., 80% vs. 50% for high skill). 
2. White-collar jobs generally offer higher salaries than blue-collar across genders.
3. Despite slightly lower salary premiums within white-collar roles, males' greater access to these occupations results in an overall positive effect on their salary through occupation."
79,no,The 40% rate among medicated individuals might reflect pre-existing conditions rather than the medication's effect. Comparing groups without controlling for underlying health issues can lead to incorrect conclusions. The lower probability doesn't automatically mean causation.
80,no,"1. Method 1 shows overall correlation but may conflate with poverty effects.
2. Method 2 isolates water quality's effect by accounting for poverty variations.
3. Choosing depends on research aim: general trend vs. causal insight. For accurate understanding of water quality’s direct impact, Method 2 is better."
81,yes,"Non-users have 74% probability, users have 30%. Lower percentage for users indicates decreased chance. Data comparison shows inverse relationship."
82,no,"Conflicting data presents inconsistency (same conditions have different probabilities). If considering first two scenarios: signing reduces probability from 71% to 31%, suggesting no increase. However, due to contradictions in given data (third and fourth scenarios), conclusions are unreliable until errors are resolved."
83,yes,"1. Calculate P(¬S)=1-0.81=0.19.
2. Total probability of R: (0.86×0.81)+(0.21×0.19)=0.7365.
3. Thus, P(R)=~74% > P(¬R)=~26%, so yes."
84,no,"Obesity increases diabetes risk. Method 1 correlates obesity with lifespan but doesn’t account for diabetes as a mediator/confounder. Method 2 examines the correlation within subgroups (diabetic/non-diabetic), separating direct and indirect effects. This separation clarifies if obesity affects lifespan beyond its link to diabetes, making Method 2 more precise."
85,no,"Total P(High Exam)=7%+28%=35%. Conditional P(High|Encouragement)=7%/10%=70%, while P(High|Discouragement)=28%/90%≈31.11%. Since 70% > 31%, the chance is not smaller."
86,yes,"Male → No Treatment (1). Male + Treatment → Recovery (2). Observed: Male. If instead of Treatment, No Treatment is given: Since being male already causes No Treatment (1), applying No Treatment aligns with this cause. The recovery pathway (2) requires Treatment which is absent. Thus, no recovery."
87,yes,"Total low cholesterol = (Probability not taking drugs * their low cholesterol) + (probability taking all * their low). Calculated as: (0.71*67%) + (0.29*49%) ≈ 61.8%, which is higher than high cholesterol (~38%)."
88,yes,"1. The question asks if parents' intelligence directly affects child's intelligence, ignoring mediation via social status.
2. Ignore confounder effects on social status since mediation is disregarded.
3. Compare probabilities: unintelligent parents have 32-45% child intelligence; intelligent parents have 74-75%.
4. Higher percentages for intelligent parents show positive direct effect."
89,no,"Unvaccinated: 51% survival vs Vaccinated:40% survival → 40% <51% → vaccinated have lower survival chance. However, this contradicts real-world vaccine efficacy where vaccines usually increase survival. Data might be hypothetical or flawed."
90,yes,"1. The confounder being active directly causes low cholesterol.
2. Since the confounder is active and not affected by drug assignment/taking in this scenario,
3. Low cholesterol will occur regardless of drug-taking behavior (including taking none instead of all)."
91,no,"The probability of forest fire is higher (75%) when campers don't light a match and lower (59%) when they do. This correlation suggests that lighting a match is associated with a *lower* chance of火灾, not higher. The data indicates an inverse relationship, though causation isn’t proven. Since the question asks if lighting increases risk: **No**, based on given probabilities."
92,yes,"1. Large kidney stone requires treatment (given). 2. Treatment leads to recovery when applied to large stones (given). 3. Patient has a large stone. Therefore, providing treatment should result in recovery, as per the stated premises."
93,yes,"1. Calculate P(High Salary | College): 0.52 / 0.92 ≈ 56.5%. 
2. Calculate P(High Salary | High School): 0.02 / (1 - 0.92) = 25%. 
3. Compare the two: 56.5% > 25%, so yes."
94,no,"Method 1 doesn't account for unobserved confounders that may influence both smoking and birth weight (like socioeconomic status), leading to biased results. Method 2 attempts to control these confounders, providing a more accurate estimate of the direct effect of maternal smoking on birth weight."
95,yes,"The candle is out of wax. Blowing out a candle and its having wax both lead to darkness. Since the candle has no wax left, even if not blown out, it can’t burn anymore. Thus, the room remains dark regardless."
96,yes,"The conditional probability of high salary given college degree is (0.28/0.8)=0.35 (35%). The complement group has P=0.14/(1-0.8)=70%. Since 35% < 70%, having a college degree correlates with lower chance."
97,no,"1. The premises state S ∨ G → NB and S ∧ G ∧ NB → HM.
2. With ¬G, a smoking mother still achieves NB due to S (∵ S∨G is true).
3. However, since the mother has poor health (¬G), even with smoking and NB, HM via Premise 2 fails because it requires G.
4. If switched to nonsmoking (¬S) & ¬G: S∨G becomes false, so NB isn't guaranteed; thus conditions for HM aren’t met either."
98,no,"1. Given: P(High Mortality | Nonsmoker) = 62%, P(High Mortality | Smoker)=74%.
2. The infants in question have smoking mothers (P=74%).
3. Question asks if it's more likely to see high mortality IF the mother was a nonsmoker: Compare 62% vs current scenario (74%). 
4. Since 62% < 74%, high mortality is less likely in the hypothetical nonsmoking case.
